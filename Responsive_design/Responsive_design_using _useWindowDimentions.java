The `useWindowDimensions` hook in React Native allows you to get the current dimensions of the window, including the width and height. This can be useful for creating responsive app designs, where the layout of your app adjusts based on the size of the device it is running on.

Here is an example of how to use the `useWindowDimensions` hook:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = useState(0);
  const [windowHeight, setWindowHeight] = useState(0);

  const { width, height } = useWindowDimensions();

  useEffect(() => {
    setWindowWidth(width);
    setWindowHeight(height);
  }, [width, height]);

  return (
    <View style={{
      width: windowWidth,
      height: windowHeight,
      justifyContent: 'center',
      alignItems: 'center',
    }}>
      <Text>Window width: {windowWidth}</Text>
      <Text>Window height: {windowHeight}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This code will render a view that displays the current width and height of the window. The view will be resized to match the dimensions of the window, so it will look good on any device.

You can use the `windowWidth` and `windowHeight` variables to adjust the layout of your app based on the size of the device. For example, you could use a different font size for different device sizes, or you could show or hide certain elements based on the device size.

Here is an example of how to use the `windowWidth` variable to adjust the font size of a text component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = useState(0);

  const { width } = useWindowDimensions();

  useEffect(() => {
    setWindowWidth(width);
  }, [width]);

  const fontSize = windowWidth > 500 ? 24 : 16;

  return (
    <View style={{
      justifyContent: 'center',
      alignItems: 'center',
    }}>
      <Text style={{ fontSize }}>This is my text component.</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This code will render a text component with a font size of 24 if the device width is greater than 500 pixels, or a font size of 16 if the device width is less than or equal to 500 pixels.

You can use the `useWindowDimensions` hook in a variety of ways to create responsive app designs. By understanding how to use this hook, you can create apps that look good on any device.
