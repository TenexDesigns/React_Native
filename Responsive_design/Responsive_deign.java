To create a responsive design in a React Native app, you can use the `useWindowDimensions` hook from the `react-native` library. This hook provides the dimensions of the device's window, allowing you to adjust your UI components based on the screen size. Here's how to use it with some code samples:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, useWindowDimensions, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
```

2. Create your component and use the `useWindowDimensions` hook to get the screen dimensions:

```javascript
const ResponsiveComponent = () => {
  const windowDimensions = useWindowDimensions();

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Screen Width: {windowDimensions.width}
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Screen Height: {windowDimensions.height}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

3. Define styles for your components:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
});
```

In this example, we create a `ResponsiveComponent` that uses the `useWindowDimensions` hook to access the screen width and height. We then display these dimensions in `Text` components. You can use these dimensions to make responsive decisions in your app, such as adjusting the layout or component sizes based on screen size.

Remember that responsive design in React Native often involves using Flexbox for layout and dynamically calculating styles or component sizes based on the screen dimensions obtained with `useWindowDimensions`. This allows your app to adapt gracefully to various screen sizes and orientations.
