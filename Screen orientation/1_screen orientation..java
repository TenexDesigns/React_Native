To determine which mode is used in React Native, you can use the `useDimensions` hook from the `@react-native-community/hooks` package. This hook returns an object with the current width and height of the device. You can then use this object to determine the mode by checking the width and height values.

For example, the following code uses the `useDimensions` hook to determine if the device is in landscape mode:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useDimensions } from '@react-native-community/hooks';

const App = () => {
  const { width, height } = useDimensions();

  const isLandscape = width > height;

  return (
    <View>
      {isLandscape ? (
        <Text>The device is in landscape mode.</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>The device is in portrait mode.</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

You can also use the `useWindowDimensions` hook from the React Native core library to determine the current width and height of the device. However, the `useDimensions` hook is recommended because it also takes into account the soft input mode, which can affect the height of the device.

**Applications of landscape and portrait mode**

Landscape mode is typically used for applications that require more screen space, such as video games, photo editing apps, and productivity apps. Portrait mode is typically used for applications that require more interaction, such as social media apps, messaging apps, and e-commerce apps.

Here are some specific examples of applications that typically use landscape mode:

* Video games
* Photo editing apps
* Productivity apps
* Music players
* Video players
* Map apps
* GPS apps

Here are some specific examples of applications that typically use portrait mode:

* Social media apps
* Messaging apps
* E-commerce apps
* News apps
* Book reading apps
* Web browsers

You can also use both landscape and portrait mode in your React Native apps. For example, you could use landscape mode for certain screens in your app, such as a photo editing screen or a video player screen, and portrait mode for other screens, such as a main menu screen or a settings screen.

By using landscape and portrait mode appropriately, you can create React Native apps that are user-friendly and provide the best possible experience for your users.
