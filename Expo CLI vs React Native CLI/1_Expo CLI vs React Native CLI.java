Expo CLI and React Native CLI are two popular ways to develop mobile apps with React Native. Each approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on your project requirements and preferences. Here's an overview of Expo CLI and React Native CLI, along with their pros, cons, and differences:

**Expo CLI:**

1. **Pros:**

   - **Simplified Setup:** Expo CLI provides an easy and streamlined setup process, making it ideal for beginners. You don't need to configure native modules, SDKs, or build tools.
   
   - **Rapid Development:** With Expo, you can quickly prototype and develop apps using the Expo client app on your device or an emulator. This speeds up development iterations.
   
   - **Built-in Libraries:** Expo comes with a set of pre-built libraries and components (Expo SDK) for common features like camera, maps, and push notifications.
   
   - **Over-the-Air Updates:** Expo allows you to push updates to your app without going through the app store review process.

   - **Online Build Service:** You can use Expo's online build service to create standalone app binaries without managing Xcode or Android Studio.

2. **Cons:**

   - **Limited Native Modules:** Expo limits the use of certain native modules. If your app requires custom native code or specific modules not included in Expo's SDK, it might not be suitable.
   
   - **Lack of Full Control:** Expo abstracts some native development aspects, which means you have less control over the native code and dependencies.

**React Native CLI:**

1. **Pros:**

   - **Full Native Access:** React Native CLI offers complete access to native modules, enabling you to integrate any native functionality and libraries.
   
   - **Customization:** You have the flexibility to customize and configure your project to meet specific requirements.
   
   - **Ecosystem Compatibility:** React Native CLI is compatible with the entire React Native ecosystem, including third-party libraries and modules.

2. **Cons:**

   - **Complex Setup:** Setting up a React Native project with the CLI can be more complex, involving manual configuration of native modules, SDKs, and build tools.
   
   - **Steep Learning Curve:** It may be challenging for beginners, as it requires a deeper understanding of native development concepts.

**Differences:**

1. **Setup and Configuration:** Expo CLI provides a simplified, managed development environment with minimal setup, while React Native CLI offers more control but requires manual configuration.

2. **Native Modules:** Expo limits the use of custom native modules, while React Native CLI allows full access to native functionality.

3. **Development Workflow:** Expo offers a quicker development workflow with the Expo client app, whereas React Native CLI might have longer build times for native code changes.

4. **Over-the-Air Updates:** Expo supports over-the-air updates, allowing you to push updates directly to users. React Native CLI requires app store updates for changes.

5. **Publishing:** Expo uses its own publishing service for app distribution, while React Native CLI relies on app store deployments.

**Which One to Choose:**

Choose Expo CLI if:

- You are a beginner or want a simplified development experience.
- Your app can be built using Expo's built-in libraries and doesn't require extensive custom native code.
- Rapid prototyping and frequent updates are essential for your project.

Choose React Native CLI if:

- You need full control over native modules and custom native code.
- Your project has complex requirements that can't be met within Expo's limitations.
- You are comfortable with native development concepts and tools.

Ultimately, the choice depends on the specific needs of your project and your level of expertise with React Native and native development. You can also start with Expo for rapid development and transition to React Native CLI if your project's requirements evolve.
