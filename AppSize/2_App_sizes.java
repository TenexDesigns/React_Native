React Native Expo apps can be larger in size than native apps, especially if you use a lot of third-party libraries and native components. This is because Expo includes a lot of code to support its features, such as over-the-air updates and access to pre-built libraries.

Here are some tips for reducing the size of your React Native Expo app:

* Use fewer third-party libraries and native components. If you don't need a particular library or component, don't include it in your app.
* Optimize your images and other assets. Use compression and other techniques to reduce the size of your images and other assets.
* Use code splitting. Code splitting allows you to split your code into multiple bundles, which can be loaded on demand. This can reduce the initial size of your app and improve its performance.
* Use lazy loading. Lazy loading allows you to load components only when they are needed. This can also reduce the initial size of your app and improve its performance.

If you are still having problems reducing the size of your app, you may need to consider using a different development environment, such as React Native without Expo.

Here are some additional tips for dealing with the large size of React Native Expo apps:

* Use a fast internet connection when downloading and installing Expo apps.
* Use a fast device to run Expo apps.
* Consider using a cloud-based development environment, such as Expo Snack, to develop and test your Expo apps.

I hope this helps!
