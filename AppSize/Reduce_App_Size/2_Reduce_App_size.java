To optimize assets, remove unused code, and enable minification and compression in a React Native project, you can follow the steps below:

1. **Optimize Assets**
   - Use optimized and compressed assets to reduce their size[^13^].
   - Convert images to a more efficient format (like WebP) or reduce their resolution without drastically compromising quality[^13^].
   - Consider lazy-loading or dynamically loading assets when they are needed rather than including them all upfront[^13^].

2. **Remove Unused Code**
   - Use a tool like [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) to remove unused code from your JavaScript files[^1^].
   - Implement tree shaking to eliminate unused exports. If you're using Webpack, you can use the `optimization.innerGraph` configuration[^1^].
   - Code splitting can help further reduce bundle size by only loading the code necessary for the initial render, and then loading other parts as needed[^1^].

3. **Minification and Compression**
   - Enable code minification when building your app. Minification reduces the size of your JavaScript code by removing whitespace and renaming variables[^1^][^2^][^12^].
   - If you're using Webpack, you can enable this with the `optimization.minimize` configuration[^1^].
   - Compression can further reduce the bundle size[^4^]. Gzip and Brotli are popular algorithms for compressing JavaScript files[^6^].

Here's an example of how to apply these optimizations in a Webpack configuration:

```javascript
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    minimize: true,
    minimizer: [new TerserPlugin()],
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
    },
    innerGraph: true,
  },
  //...
};
```

In this example, the `TerserPlugin` is used to minify the code and remove unused code[^1^]. The `splitChunks` option is used to split the code into separate chunks[^1^]. The `innerGraph` option is used to conduct inner graph analysis for unused exports[^1^].

Please note that these optimizations should be applied in the production build of your app, not in the development build, as they can make the build process slower and the output harder to debug[^1^][^2^][^12^].
