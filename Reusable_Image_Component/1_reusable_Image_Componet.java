Creating a component in React Native that can receive dynamic images can be done in a straightforward way. You can pass the image path or URL as a prop to the component, and then use this prop as the source for an `Image` component. However, how you pass the image depends on whether it's a local image or a network image.

If the image is a local file, you should `require` it where you're defining the prop. Here's an example:

```jsx
<MyComponent imageSource={require('./path/to/image.png')} />
```

Then, in your `MyComponent` definition, you use the `imageSource` prop directly as the source for the `Image` component:

```jsx
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = ({ imageSource }) => (
  <Image source={imageSource} />
);
```

This way, you can use the `MyComponent` with different local images by changing the path in the `require` statement.

If the image is a network image, you pass the URL as a string:

```jsx
<MyComponent imageUrl={'https://example.com/path/to/image.png'} />
```

And then, in your `MyComponent` definition, you use the `imageUrl` prop as the URI for the `Image` component:

```jsx
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = ({ imageUrl }) => (
  <Image source={{ uri: imageUrl }} />
);
```

This way, you can use `MyComponent` with different network images by changing the URL string.

Remember to style your `Image` component appropriately to control its dimensions and appearance. Also, network images should have a specified dimension, since unlike local images, their dimensions are not known ahead of time [Source 8](https://blog.logrocket.com/displaying-images-with-the-react-native-image-component/), [Source 2](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/react/react-native-dynamic-image/), [Source 10](https://code.tutsplus.com/understanding-the-image-component-in-react-native--cms-35877t).





EXAMPLE FOR STATCI IMAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<SurfaceCard imageUrl={require('../assets/img/ova.png')} title={'Break fast'}/>   /// The path for the image should be relative to where consuming Image component is

----



  import { View, Text, Image } from 'react-native'
import React from 'react'
import { Surface } from '@react-native-material/core'

export default function SurfaceCard({imageUrl,title}) {

  return (
<Surface

elevation={3}
category="medium"
style={{
  justifyContent: "center",
  alignItems: "center",
  width: 165,
  height: 165,
}}

>

<Image
         source={imageUrl}
         style={{   }}
       />

       <Text style={{ paddingTop:9}}>{title}</Text>
</Surface>
  )
}
