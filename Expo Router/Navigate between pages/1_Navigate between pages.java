The information you provided is about navigating between pages with Expo Router in a React Native application. Here's a breakdown of the concepts:

1. **Links**: Expo Router uses "links" to move between pages in the app. This is similar to how the web works with `<a>` tags and the `href` attribute. For example:

```jsx
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      <Link href="/user/bacon">View user</Link>
    </View>
  );
}
```

2. **Buttons**: The `Link` component wraps the children in a `<Text>` component by default. You can customize the component by passing the `asChild` prop, which will forward all props to the first child of the `Link` component. The child component must support the `onPress` and `onClick` props, `href` and `accessibilityRole` will also be passed down. For example:

```jsx
import { Pressable, Text } from "react-native";
import { Link } from "expo-router";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Link href="/other" asChild>
      <Pressable>
        <Text>Home</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

3. **Imperative navigation**: You can use the `router` object to navigate imperatively (outside of React). For example:

```jsx
import { router } from 'expo-router';

export function logout() {
  router.replace('/login');
}
```

4. **Linking to dynamic routes**: Dynamic routes and query parameters can be provided statically or with the convenience `Href` object. For example:

```jsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Link
        href={{
          pathname: "/user/[id]",
          params: { id: 'bacon' }
        }}>
          View user
        </Link>
    </View>
  );
}
```

5. **Replacing screens**: By default, links "push" routes onto the navigation stack. This means that the previous screen will be available when the user navigates back. You can use the `replace` prop to replace the current screen instead of pushing a new one. For example:

```jsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Link
        replace
        href="/feed">
        Login
      </Link>
    </View>
  );
}
```

6. **Autocomplete**: Expo Router can automatically generate static TypeScript types for all routes in your app. This allows you to use autocomplete for hrefs and get warnings when invalid links are used.

7. **Web behavior**: Expo Router supports the standard `<a>` element when running on web, however this will perform a full-page server-navigation. Instead, the Expo Router `<Link>` component will perform client-side navigation, this will preserve the state of the website and navigate faster.






You can also use the router object to navigate between pages imperatively. The router object is immutable and contains the following functions:

push(): Navigates to a route. You can provide a full path like /profile/settings or a relative path like ../settings. Navigate to dynamic routes by passing an object like { pathname: 'profile', params: { id: '123' } }.
replace(): Same API as push() but replaces the current route in the history instead of pushing a new one. This is useful for redirects.
back(): Navigates back to the previous route.
canGoBack(): Returns true if a valid history stack exists and the back() function can pop back.
setParams(): Updates the query params for the currently selected route.
