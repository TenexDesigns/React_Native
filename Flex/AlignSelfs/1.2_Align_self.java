The `alignSelf` prop in React Native is used to align a single item along the cross axis, overriding the `alignItems` of the parent. The default `alignSelf` value in React Native is `auto`. This means that the item will inherit the `alignItems` of its parent.

**Do the Items have auto align items , and then inheritÂ the alignItems speciefied in the parent?**

Yes, items in React Native have auto align items by default. This means that they will inherit the `alignItems` of their parent. However, you can override the `alignItems` of the parent by setting the `alignSelf` prop on the item.

**Code samples**

The following code sample shows how to use the `alignSelf` prop to override the `alignItems` of the parent:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{
      flexDirection: 'column',
      alignItems: 'flex-start',
    }}>
      <Text>This is the first item.</Text>
      <Text style={{ alignSelf: 'center' }}>This is the second item.</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This code will render a container with two items, laid out one on top of the other. The first item will be aligned to the start of the cross axis, while the second item will be centered along the cross axis.

**Conclusion**

The `alignSelf` prop is a powerful tool that can be used to override the `alignItems` of the parent and align individual items along the cross axis. By understanding how to use the `alignSelf` prop, you can create more complex and visually appealing layouts for your React Native apps.
