In React Native, the `alignSelf` property is used to align individual child components within their container. It is similar to `alignItems`, but it works on a single child component instead of all the children within a container. `alignSelf` overrides any `alignItems` property set on the parent container [Source 3](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-flexbox-react-native/), [Source 10](https://tvke.github.io/react-native-tailwindcss/flexbox/align-self.html).

The possible values for `alignSelf` are:

- `auto`: This is the default value. The component will follow the `alignItems` value of its parent container.
- `stretch`: The component will stretch to fill the height (if `flexDirection` is `row`) or width (if `flexDirection` is `column`) of the container's secondary axis.
- `center`: The component is aligned at the center of the container's secondary axis.
- `flex-start`: The component is aligned at the beginning of the container's secondary axis.
- `flex-end`: The component is aligned at the end of the container's secondary axis.
- `baseline`: The component is aligned at their baseline [Source 5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self).

Here's an example that illustrates how `alignSelf` works:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';

const AlignSelfExample = () => (
  <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <View style={{ width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'red' }} />
    <View style={{ width: 50, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'blue', alignSelf: 'flex-end' }} />
  </View>
);

export default AlignSelfExample;
```

In this example, the `alignItems` property of the parent container is set to `center`, which means all child views would normally be centered along the vertical axis. However, the blue view has `alignSelf` set to `flex-end`, which means it aligns itself to the end of the container's vertical axis, overriding the `alignItems` property of the parent container [Source 3](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-flexbox-react-native/).
