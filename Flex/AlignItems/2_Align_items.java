In React Native, the `alignItems` property is used to align child components along the secondary axis of their container, which is perpendicular to the primary axis specified by `flexDirection` [Source 0](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-native-flexbox-alignitems-property/), [Source 2](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-flexbox-react-native/).

The possible values for `alignItems` include:

- `stretch`: This is the default value. Child components are stretched to fit the height (if `flexDirection` is `row`) or width (if `flexDirection` is `column`) of the container's secondary axis.
- `center`: Child components are aligned at the center of the container's secondary axis.
- `flex-start`: Child components are aligned at the beginning of the container's secondary axis.
- `flex-end`: Child components are aligned at the end of the container's secondary axis.
- `baseline`: Child components are aligned at their baseline [Source 0](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-native-flexbox-alignitems-property/).

Here's an example that illustrates how `alignItems` works:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';

const AlignItemsExample = () => (
  <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <View style={{ width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'red' }} />
    <View style={{ width: 50, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
  </View>
);

export default AlignItemsExample;
```

In this example, the `alignItems` property is set to `center`, which means the red and blue views are centered along the vertical axis of the container. Because the `flexDirection` is set to `row`, the secondary axis is vertical [Source 2](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-flexbox-react-native/).

Remember that `alignItems` affects the alignment of child components along the secondary axis, while `justifyContent` affects the alignment along the primary axis. Also, `alignItems` works in conjunction with `flexDirection`, and its behavior changes depending on whether `flexDirection` is set to `row` or `column` [Source 1](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).
