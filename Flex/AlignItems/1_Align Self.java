The alignItems property is used to control how flex items are aligned along the cross-axis of their container. 

The default value for alignItems in React Native is 'stretch'. This means that, by default, flex items will stretch to fill the entire cross-axis of their container,
ensuring that they have the same height (if the main axis is horizontal) or the same width (if the main axis is vertical) within their container.

In React Native, the `alignItems` property is used to control how flex items are aligned along the cross-axis of their container. The cross-axis is perpendicular to the main axis, which is determined by the `flexDirection` property. `alignItems` is particularly useful when working with flex layouts.

The `alignItems` property can take the following values:

1. `'flex-start'`: This aligns items to the start (or top if the `flexDirection` is `'column'`) of the cross-axis. It's the default value.

   ```jsx
   <View style={{ alignItems: 'flex-start' }}>Align items to the start</View>
   ```

2. `'flex-end'`: This aligns items to the end (or bottom if the `flexDirection` is `'column'`) of the cross-axis.

   ```jsx
   <View style={{ alignItems: 'flex-end' }}>Align items to the end</View>
   ```

3. `'center'`: This centers items along the cross-axis.

   ```jsx
   <View style={{ alignItems: 'center' }}>Center-align items</View>
   ```

4. `'stretch'`: This stretches the items to fill the entire cross-axis. This is the default behavior if no `alignItems` property is specified.

   ```jsx
   <View style={{ alignItems: 'stretch' }}>Stretch items</View>
   ```

5. `'baseline'`: This aligns items such that their baselines align. This is especially useful when dealing with text or items with text.

   ```jsx
   <View style={{ alignItems: 'baseline' }}>Align items by baseline</View>
   ```

The default value for `alignItems` in React Native is `'stretch'`. This means that, by default, flex items will stretch to fill the entire cross-axis of their container, ensuring that they have the same height (if the main axis is horizontal) or the same width (if the main axis is vertical) within their container.

Here's an example using `alignItems`:

```jsx
<View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <Text>Item 1</Text>
  <Text>Item 2</Text>
</View>
```

In this example, the `alignItems: 'center'` property centers the text elements vertically within the row container.
