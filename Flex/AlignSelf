The alignSelf prop in React Native is used to align a single item along the cross axis, overriding the alignItems of the parent.
The default alignSelf value in React Native is auto. This means that the item will inherit the alignItems of its parent.



Yes, items in React Native have auto align items by default. This means that they will inherit the alignItems of their parent. 
However, you can override the alignItems of the parent by setting the alignSelf prop on the item.
