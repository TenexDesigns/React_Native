There are two main ways to pass data between screens in an Expo React Native app:

1. **Using React Navigation:** React Navigation provides a built-in way to pass data between screens using the `params` prop. To do this, simply pass the data that you want to pass as an object to the `params` prop of the `navigate()` function. For example, to pass the data `{ name: 'John Doe' }` to the `Profile` screen, you would use the following code:

```
navigation.navigate('Profile', { name: 'John Doe' });
```

You can then access the passed data on the `Profile` screen using the `route.params` object. For example:

```
const Profile = () => {
  const { name } = route.params;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, {name}!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

2. **Using Redux:** Redux is a state management library that can be used to pass data between screens in an Expo React Native app. To use Redux, you need to create a Redux store and then connect your components to the store. Once your components are connected to the store, you can access the state of the store in your components and update it as needed.

To pass data between screens using Redux, you can use the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks. The `useSelector` hook allows you to select a value from the Redux store, and the `useDispatch` hook allows you to dispatch an action to the Redux store.

For example, to pass the data `{ name: 'John Doe' }` to the `Profile` screen, you would use the following code:

```
const Profile = () => {
  const name = useSelector((state) => state.name);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, {name}!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

And then to update the value of the `name` property in the Redux store, you would use the following code:

```
const dispatch = useDispatch();

dispatch({
  type: 'UPDATE_NAME',
  payload: {
    name: 'John Doe',
  },
});
```

Which method you use to pass data between screens in your Expo React Native app depends on your specific needs. If you only need to pass a small amount of data between screens, then using React Navigation is probably the simplest solution. However, if you need to pass a large amount of data between screens or if you need to share data between many different screens, then using Redux is probably a better solution.

I hope this helps!
