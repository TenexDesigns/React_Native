TextInput is a foundational component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard. It is a controlled component, which means that the state of the TextInput is managed by the parent component.

Here is a simple example of a TextInput component:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { TextInput } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const handleChangeText = (newText) => {
    setText(newText);
  };

  return (
    <TextInput
      value={text}
      onChangeText={handleChangeText}
    />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This code will render a simple text input field. The `value` prop is used to set the initial value of the text input field. The `onChangeText` prop is a callback function that is called whenever the text in the input field changes.

Here are some of the most common props for TextInput:

* `value`: The initial value of the text input field.
* `onChangeText`: A callback function that is called whenever the text in the input field changes.
* `placeholder`: The text that is displayed in the input field when it is empty.
* `keyboardType`: The type of keyboard that is displayed when the input field is focused.
* `multiline`: Whether the input field is multiline.
* `secureTextEntry`: Whether the input field should obscure the text.

Here is an example of how to use some of the other props:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { TextInput } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const handleChangeText = (newText) => {
    setText(newText);
  };

  return (
    <TextInput
      value={text}
      onChangeText={handleChangeText}
      placeholder="Enter your name"
      keyboardType="email-address"
      multiline={true}
      secureTextEntry={true}
    />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This code will render a multiline text input field that is obscured. The keyboard type will be set to email address, so the user will be prompted to enter an email address.

TextInput also supports a number of other props, such as `maxLength`, `autoFocus`, and `style`. For more information, please see the React Native documentation.

**Third-party libraries**

There are also a number of third-party libraries that extend the functionality of TextInput in React Native. Some of the most popular libraries include:

* React Native Form Toolkit: A comprehensive set of form components that are easy to use and highly customizable.
* React Native Elements: A library of cross-platform React Native components that are styled to look and feel native.
* React Native Material UI: A library of React Native components that are inspired by Google's Material Design.

These libraries provide a number of additional features for TextInput, such as validation, error handling, and styling.

I hope this helps!
