To package your React Native Expo app and make it downloadable and installable on Android, you can use the following steps:

1. Build your app for Android:

```
expo build:android
```

2. This will create an APK file in the `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/` directory.

3. You can then upload this APK file to your website and make it available for download.

4. To install the APK file on an Android device, the user can enable "Install from unknown sources" in the device's settings.

5. Then, the user can navigate to the APK file in the device's file manager and tap on it to install it.

Here are some additional tips for packaging and distributing your React Native Expo app:

* Make sure to sign your APK file before distributing it. This will help to ensure the security of your app.
* You can use a service like Expo Go to distribute your app to beta testers.
* You can also use a service like Google Play to distribute your app to the general public.

If you are targeting a specific audience, you may also want to consider distributing your app through a private app store.

I hope this helps!
