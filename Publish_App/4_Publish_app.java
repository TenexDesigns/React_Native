To make your React Native Expo app downloadable and installable from your website, you can follow these steps:

1. Build your Expo app: You can build your Expo app by running the command `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios` depending on the platform you want to build for. This will create a `.apk` file for Android or a `.ipa` file for iOS.

2. Host the build files: You will need to host the `.apk` or `.ipa` file on your website so that users can download it. You can use a file hosting service like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage to host the file.

3. Provide instructions for installation: You will need to provide instructions for users on how to install the app on their device. For Android, users can download the `.apk` file and then enable installation from unknown sources in their device settings. For iOS, users will need to download the `.ipa` file and then install it using Xcode or a third-party tool like Cydia Impactor.

4. Test the installation: Before making the app available for download, you should test the installation process to make sure it works correctly.

Its important to note that when you build your Expo app, it will be a "managed" app, which means that it will have certain limitations compared to a "bare" app that is built using React Native CLI[5]. For example, you won't be able to use certain native packages without ejecting from Expo[5].
