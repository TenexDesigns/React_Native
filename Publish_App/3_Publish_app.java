To distribute your React Native application built with Expo as a downloadable file from a website, you need to build a standalone app binary for Android (an APK or AAB file) and provide users with a link to download this file. This process is also known as sideloading.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Build a Standalone App Binary**
   - Run `expo build:android` in your project directory. This command will start a build in the cloud and return a URL[^2^].
   - You can check the status of your build by pasting the URL into your web browser. Once the build is completed, the page will display a URL to download the APK or AAB file[^2^].
   - Download the APK or AAB file to your local machine[^2^].

2. **Host the APK or AAB file on a server**
   - You can use any web server to host the APK or AAB file. If you don't have a web server, there are many services available like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or even GitHub[^2^].
   - Upload the APK or AAB file to your server and make it publicly accessible.

3. **Provide a Download Link**
   - Once the file is hosted on a server, you can provide users with the direct link to download the APK or AAB file[^2^].
   - Users can download the file to their Android device and install the app by opening the file from their device's file manager[^2^].

Please note that by default, Android devices do not allow installations from unknown sources. Users will need to enable installations from unknown sources in their device settings before they can install the app[^2^].

Also, be aware that sideloading bypasses the app stores safety checks, so it should only be used with trusted sources. Always ensure that your app does not violate the user's privacy or security[^2^].

Remember, if you make updates to your app, you will need to repeat this process to create a new APK or AAB file and update the file on your server. Users will also need to manually download and install the updated app[^2^].
