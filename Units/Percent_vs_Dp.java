In React Native, percent and dp units of measurement are relative to the parent container. This means that the size of an element that is measured in percent or dp will change depending on the size of its parent container.

For example, if you have a view that is 50% wide and its parent container is 200 pixels wide, then the view will be 100 pixels wide. If you resize the parent container to 100 pixels wide, then the view will also be 50 pixels wide.

Percent and dp units of measurement are useful for creating layouts that are responsive to different screen sizes and device densities. For example, if you have a button that is 50% wide, it will be half the width of its parent container, regardless of the size or density of the screen.

Here is an example of how to use percent and dp units of measurement in React Native:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}>
      <View style={{ width: '50%', height: '50%' }}>
        <Text>This view is 50% wide and 50% high relative to its parent container.</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This code will render a view that is 300 pixels wide and 300 pixels high. Inside of that view, there will be another view that is 50% wide and 50% high relative to its parent container.

It is important to note that percent and dp units of measurement can only be used to measure the size of elements. You cannot use them to measure the position of elements.

I hope this helps!
