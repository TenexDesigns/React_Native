In React Native, the units of measurement used for sizing components and their properties are independent of the device's pixel density. Unlike CSS in web development, where you have a variety of units like `px`, `em`, `rem`, `%`, etc., React Native only uses Density-independent Pixels (dp) and percentage(%).

1. Density-independent Pixels (dp):
   - A dp is an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. It allows you to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system of a "medium" density screen[^4^].
   - React Native uses logical pixels, which can be thought of as equivalent to dp[^8^]. These are not physical pixels on the device screen, but are a unit that allows for density-independent layout. All dimensions in React Native are unitless and represent density-independent pixels[^3^].
   - Here's an example of using dp in a style:

     ```jsx
     const styles = StyleSheet.create({
       container: {
         width: 300,  // dp
         height: 200,  // dp
       },
     });
     ```

   - In this example, the width and height of the container are set to `300dp` and `200dp`, respectively[^3^].

2. Percentage (%):
   - Percentage is a relative unit that is based on the parent's size. It is used to create responsive layouts in React Native.
   - Percentage can be used for a few style properties in React Native, including `width`, `height`, and `flex`, but it's not universally supported for all style properties[^3^].
   - Here's an example of using percentage in a style:

     ```jsx
     const styles = StyleSheet.create({
       container: {
         width: '50%',  // 50% of parent's width
         height: '30%',  // 30% of parent's height
       },
     });
     ```

   - In this example, the width and height of the container are set to `50%` and `30%` of the parent's width and height, respectively[^3^].

Therefore, both dp and percentage in React Native are used to create layouts that can scale across different screen sizes and densities. They allow you to create responsive layouts that adjust appropriately to the screen size and density of the device. Dp is a density-independent unit that remains consistent across devices, while percentage is a relative unit that adjusts based on the size of the parent container[^4^][^3^].
