While Android App Bundles (AAB) are the new standard for apps uploaded to the Google Play Store, they cannot be directly installed on an Android device like APK files[^3^][^5^][^9^][^10^]. This is because AAB files include all your application's compiled code and resources, but defer APK generation and signing to Google Play[^3^][^9^][^10^].

However, you can use Google's `bundletool` to generate a set of APKs from an AAB file, and then install those APKs on a device[^3^]. You can also use a third-party app like `App Bundle Installer` to install AAB files[^5^].

Here are the steps to use `bundletool`:

1. Download `bundletool` from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases).

2. Generate a set of APKs from the AAB file using the following command:

   ```
   java -jar bundletool-all-1.10.0.jar build-apks --bundle=<Path of your aab> --output=<PathForTheOutput>
   ```

   Replace `<Path of your aab>` with the path to your AAB file and `<PathForTheOutput>` with the output path for the APKs[^3^].

3. If you are planning to install all the APKs locally from the APK set, use the following command:

   ```
   java -jar bundletool-all-1.10.0.jar install-apks --apks=<Path of your apks>
   ```

   Replace `<Path of your apks>` with the path to your APKs[^3^].

For the `App Bundle Installer`:

1. Download and install the `App Bundle Installer` app from the Google Play Store[^5^].

2. Open the app and tap on `Select AAB`[^5^].

3. Choose the AAB file from your file manager and tap on the `Install File` button[^5^].

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation[^5^].

Remember, AAB files are directly uploaded to Google Play, and you can't directly install them using the native package installer[^5^][^9^][^10^]. You will need to use a tool like `bundletool` or an app like `App Bundle Installer` to install AAB files[^3^][^5^].

If you want to avoid these steps, you can build an APK in Expo instead of an AAB. To do this, run `expo build:android -t apk` in your project directory[^0^]. This will start a build in the cloud and return a URL. You can check the status of your build by pasting the URL into your web browser. Once the build is completed, the page will display a URL to download the APK file[^0^].
