Expo is a platform for building cross-platform mobile apps with React Native. It offers a number of features that make it easier to develop and deploy React Native apps, including:

* **Over-the-air updates:** Expo apps can be updated without the user having to download a new version from the app store.
* **Pre-built libraries:** Expo provides a number of pre-built libraries for common tasks, such as camera access, geolocation, and push notifications. This can save you a lot of time and effort.
* **Expo Go:** Expo Go is a mobile app that allows you to test and run Expo apps without having to deploy them to a device. This can be very useful for development and debugging.

However, Expo also has some disadvantages:

* **App size:** Expo apps can be larger than native apps, especially if you use a lot of third-party libraries and native components.
* **Performance:** Expo apps may not perform as well as native apps, especially on older devices.
* **Customization:** Expo apps are less customizable than native apps. This is because Expo provides a number of pre-built components and features, and it can be difficult to override them.

Vanilla React Native is a framework for building cross-platform mobile apps with React. It does not offer any of the features that Expo provides, but it is also more flexible and customizable.

Here is a table that summarizes the pros and cons of Expo and vanilla React Native:

| Feature | Expo | Vanilla React Native |
|---|---|---|
| Over-the-air updates | Yes | No |
| Pre-built libraries | Yes | No |
| Expo Go | Yes | No |
| App size | Larger | Smaller |
| Performance | May not be as good | Good |
| Customization | Less customizable | More customizable |

**App sizes**

The size of an Expo app will vary depending on the features and libraries that you use. However, Expo apps are generally larger than native apps. This is because Expo includes a lot of code to support its features, such as over-the-air updates and access to pre-built libraries.

**Using Expo libraries in vanilla React Native**

It is possible to use Expo libraries in vanilla React Native, but it is not recommended. Expo libraries are designed to be used with Expo, and they may not work properly in vanilla React Native apps.

If you need to use an Expo library in your vanilla React Native app, you should check the library's documentation to see if it is compatible with vanilla React Native. If the library is not compatible, you may need to find a different library.

**Conclusion**

Expo and vanilla React Native are both good choices for building cross-platform mobile apps. However, they have different strengths and weaknesses.

Expo is a good choice if you want to develop and deploy your app quickly and easily. It also offers a number of features that can make your app more user-friendly, such as over-the-air updates and pre-built libraries.

Vanilla React Native is a good choice if you need to create a highly customized or performant app. However, it can be more difficult to develop and deploy vanilla React Native apps, and they may not have some of the features that Expo apps have, such as over-the-air updates.

I hope this helps!
