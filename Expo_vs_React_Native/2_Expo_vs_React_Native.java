Expo and vanilla React Native are both popular choices for developing mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice depends on your specific needs and the complexity of your project.

**Expo**[^0^][^2^][^3^][^4^][^6^][^8^][^10^]:

Pros:
- Simplifies the development and testing process with a set of pre-built tools and services.
- Provides a smooth development experience with a live-reloading development server and access to many APIs out of the box.
- Allows you to build and share apps without needing Xcode or Android Studio.
- Simplifies the process of building binaries for distribution on app stores.
- Includes a curated set of pre-built modules that cover popular functionalities, such as camera access, push notifications, and geolocation.

Cons:
- Includes the entire Expo SDK in the app binary, which can result in larger app sizes.
- You can't add native modules and packages, which limits the customization and can be a problem if your app requires specific features that are not available in the Expo SDK.
- Expo controls the React Native version, which can be a problem if you need features or fixes from a newer version.
- If you need to eject from Expo to add custom native code, you lose all the benefits of Expo and have to manage the native projects yourself.

**Vanilla React Native**[^0^][^2^][^3^][^4^][^6^][^8^][^10^]:

Pros:
- Gives you full control over the native project and allows for more customization.
- Allows you to add native modules written in Objective-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin, and packages that require linking.
- You have access to the entire React Native ecosystem and can seamlessly integrate any third-party library available for React Native.
- You can choose any React Native version you desire, and update to newer versions as needed.

Cons:
- Requires more setup and maintenance, as you'll need to manage the native Android and iOS projects yourself.
- Building binaries for distribution on app stores is more complex and requires Xcode for iOS apps and Android Studio for Android apps.
- Upgrading React Native can be challenging due to potential compatibility issues with the native code.

As for the app sizes, Expo apps tend to be larger due to the inclusion of the entire Expo SDK. The size of a vanilla React Native app, on the other hand, depends on the modules and assets included in the app[^0^].

Regarding the use of Expo libraries in vanilla React Native, some libraries like `expo-router` may not work outside of Expo. However, Expo has a process called "unimodules" that allows certain Expo libraries to be used in vanilla React Native projects[^4^]. Always check the documentation of the specific Expo library to see if it supports usage outside of Expo.
