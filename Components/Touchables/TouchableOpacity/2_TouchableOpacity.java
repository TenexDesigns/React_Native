The [TouchableOpacity](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchableopacity) component in React Native is a wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. When pressed down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, dimming it. 

Here is a simple example of using the TouchableOpacity component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <View {...props} style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      activeOpacity={0.6}
      onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
      <MyComponent />
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In the code above, the TouchableOpacity component wraps the MyComponent component. When MyComponent is pressed, an alert is shown due to the onPress prop of TouchableOpacity. The activeOpacity prop determines the opacity of the wrapped view when touch is active.

There are several properties associated with the TouchableOpacity component:

- `activeOpacity`: Determines the opacity of the wrapped view when touch is active. The value should be between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.2.

- `style`: This is used to apply specific styles to the TouchableOpacity. It can be used to set the width, height, and other style properties of the TouchableOpacity.

- `tvParallaxProperties`: This property is specific to Apple TV and it controls the Apple TV parallax effects. 

- `hasTVPreferredFocus`, `nextFocusDown`, `nextFocusForward`, `nextFocusLeft`, `nextFocusRight`, `nextFocusUp`: These properties are specific to TV navigation and they determine which component to focus on when navigating with a TV remote control.

Note that opacity is controlled by wrapping the children in an Animated.View, which is added to the view hierarchy. This can affect layout [Source 0](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchableopacity).
