The [TouchableHighlight](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablehighlight) component in React Native is a wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. When pressed down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, which allows the underlay color to show through, darkening or tinting the view. 

Here is a simple example of using the TouchableHighlight component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableHighlight } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <View {...props} style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <TouchableHighlight
      activeOpacity={0.6}
      underlayColor="#DDDDDD"
      onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
      <MyComponent />
    </TouchableHighlight>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In the code above, the TouchableHighlight component wraps the MyComponent component. When MyComponent is pressed, an alert is shown due to the onPress prop of TouchableHighlight. The underlayColor prop sets the color that will show through when the touch is active. The activeOpacity prop determines the opacity of the wrapped view when touch is active.

There are several properties associated with the TouchableHighlight component:

- `activeOpacity`: Determines the opacity of the wrapped view when touch is active. The value should be between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.85. Requires underlayColor to be set.

- `underlayColor`: The color of the underlay that will show through when the touch is active.

- `onHideUnderlay`: Called immediately after the underlay is hidden.

- `onShowUnderlay`: Called immediately after the underlay is shown.

- `style`: This is used to apply specific styles to the TouchableHighlight. It can be used to set the width, height, and other style properties of the TouchableHighlight.

- `hasTVPreferredFocus`, `nextFocusDown`, `nextFocusForward`, `nextFocusLeft`, `nextFocusRight`, `nextFocusUp`: These properties are specific to TV navigation and they determine which component to focus on when navigating with a TV remote control.

Note that TouchableHighlight must have one child (not zero or more than one). If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View. This is because TouchableHighlight creates a new View for the underlay color, which can affect layout [Source 0](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablehighlight).
