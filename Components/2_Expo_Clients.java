When developing with Expo CLI in React Native, you will need to be familiar with a number of components and APIs. 

React Native provides a set of built-in components and APIs, such as:

- `<ActivityIndicator>`
- `<TextInput>`
- `<Text>`
- `<ScrollView>`
- `<View>`

These can be imported from the `react-native` package in your code, like this:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: 100 }}>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

The Expo SDK also provides a range of libraries that you can use in your project. These include libraries for accessing device and system functionality such as audio, barcode scanning, camera, calendar, contacts, video, and others. They also include libraries for updates, maps, OAuth authentication tools, and more. You can find these libraries in the API Reference section of the Expo documentation or through the documentation search bar. [Source 1](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/using-libraries/)

For example, some of the libraries that you might find useful include:

- `localization`: for managing localization of your application
- `ImagePicker`/`ImageManipulator`: for opening images or videos from the device
- `Camera`: for capturing photos and videos using the deviceâ€™s camera
- `Notifications`: for handling push notifications from the Expo Push service
- `Payments`: for integrating payments via Stripe using Apple Pay and Android Pay [Source 3](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-with-react-native-and-expo-sdk/)

To use a library from the Expo SDK, you import it from the `expo` package in your code. Here's an example of how to import and use the `Camera` component from Expo:

```javascript
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
import React from 'react';
import { View, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={Camera.Constants.Type.back}>
        <View
          style={{
            flex: 1,
            backgroundColor: 'transparent',
            flexDirection: 'row',
          }}>
          <TouchableOpacity
            style={{
              flex: 0.1,
              alignSelf: 'flex-end',
              alignItems: 'center',
            }}
            onPress={() => {
              console.log('Taking a photo');
            }}>
            <Text style={{ fontSize: 18, marginBottom: 10, color: 'white' }}>
              {' '}
              Snap{' '}
            </Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
}
```
In this example, when the "Snap" text is pressed, the console logs "Taking a photo". This is a simplified version, in a real application you would probably want to use the `takePictureAsync` method of the `Camera` component to actually take a picture.

Finally, it's also worth mentioning that you may use third-party libraries in your project. To determine whether a library is compatible with your project, you can refer to the React Native Directory, which is a searchable database of libraries built specifically for React Native.
