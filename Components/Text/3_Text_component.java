The following are some important areas covered on the Text component in React Native:

* **Nesting:** Text can be nested to achieve formatting effects, such as bold and colored text. For example, the following code will render the text "This is bold and red" with bold and red formatting:

```javascript
<Text>
  This is bold
  <Text style={{ color: 'red' }}>and red</Text>
</Text>
```

* **Containers:** The Text component creates a text container, which means that elements inside of it are wrapped when they see the end of the line. This is different from View components, which do not wrap their children.
* **Limited Style Inheritance:** In React Native, text nodes must be wrapped in a Text component. Text nodes cannot be directly under a View component. This is different from the web, where text nodes can be anywhere in the DOM tree.

* **Styling:** Text can be styled using the `style` prop. The `style` prop accepts a CSS object, which can be used to set properties such as font family, font size, and color. For example, the following code will render the text "This is a header" with a font size of 20 pixels:

```javascript
<Text style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>This is a header</Text>
```

* **Accessibility:** The Text component has a number of props that can be used to make it accessible to users with disabilities. These props include `accessibilityHint`, `accessibilityLanguage`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`, `accessibilityState`, and `accessibilityActions`. For example, the following code will set the accessibility label of the text component to "This is a header":

```javascript
<Text accessibilityLabel="This is a header">This is a header</Text>
```

By understanding these important areas covered on the Text component, you can use it to create beautiful and accessible user interfaces in React Native.
