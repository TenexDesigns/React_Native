The [Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) component in React Native is a core component wrapper that can detect various stages of press interactions on any of its defined children.

Here is a simple example of using the Pressable component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Pressable, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const onPressFunction = () => {
    console.log('Pressed!');
  };

  return (
    <Pressable onPress={onPressFunction}>
      <Text>I'm pressable!</Text>
    </Pressable>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In the code above, the Pressable component wraps a Text component. When the Text is pressed, a message is logged to the console due to the onPress prop of Pressable.

There are several properties associated with the Pressable component:

- `onPress`: Called after onPressOut.

- `onPressIn`: Called immediately when a touch is engaged, before onPressOut and onPress.

- `onPressOut`: Called when a touch is released.

- `onLongPress`: Called if the time after onPressIn lasts longer than 500 milliseconds. This time period can be customized with delayLongPress.

- `delayLongPress`: Duration (in milliseconds) from onPressIn before onLongPress is called.

- `unstable_pressDelay`: Duration (in milliseconds) to wait after press down before calling onPressIn.

- `hitSlop`: Sets additional distance outside of element in which a press can be detected.

- `pressRetentionOffset`: Additional distance outside of this view in which a touch is considered a press before onPressOut is triggered.

- `style`: Either view styles or a function that receives a boolean reflecting whether the component is currently pressed and returns view styles.

- `android_ripple`: Enables the Android ripple effect and configures its properties.

- `android_disableSound`: If true, doesn't play Android system sound on press.

- `disabled`: Whether the press behavior is disabled.

- `onHoverIn` and `onHoverOut`: Called when the hover is activated/deactivated to provide/undo visual feedback [Source 0](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable).

Note that Pressable uses React Native's Pressability API. For more information around the state machine flow of Pressability and how it works, check out the implementation for Pressability [Source 0](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable).
