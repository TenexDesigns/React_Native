Learning React Native with Expo CLI is a great choice for building cross-platform mobile applications. To get started, youll need to understand the basic components and APIs provided by React Native and Expo. Here's a list of some fundamental components and how to use them:

1. **Text:** The `Text` component is used to display text on the screen. You can use it to render titles, paragraphs, or any other text-based content.

   ```jsx
   import { Text } from 'react-native';

   const MyTextComponent = () => {
     return <Text>Hello, Expo CLI!</Text>;
   };
   ```

2. **View:** The `View` component is a container that can be used to structure your user interface. It's similar to a `<div>` in web development.

   ```jsx
   import { View } from 'react-native';

   const MyViewComponent = () => {
     return (
       <View>
         <Text>Inside a View</Text>
       </View>
     );
   };
   ```

3. **Button:** The `Button` component is used to create interactive buttons that trigger actions when pressed.

   ```jsx
   import { Button } from 'react-native';

   const MyButtonComponent = () => {
     const handlePress = () => {
       // Your button press logic here
     };

     return <Button title="Press Me" onPress={handlePress} />;
   };
   ```

4. **TextInput:** The `TextInput` component allows users to input text. It's commonly used for forms and user input.

   ```jsx
   import { TextInput } from 'react-native';

   const MyTextInputComponent = () => {
     const [text, setText] = useState('');

     const handleTextChange = (newText) => {
       setText(newText);
     };

     return <TextInput value={text} onChangeText={handleTextChange} />;
   };
   ```

5. **Image:** The `Image` component is used to display images in your app.

   ```jsx
   import { Image } from 'react-native';

   const MyImageComponent = () => {
     return <Image source={require('./path-to-image.png')} />;
   };
   ```

6. **TouchableOpacity:** This component is often used to create touchable elements, similar to buttons, but with more flexibility in terms of styling.

   ```jsx
   import { TouchableOpacity, Text } from 'react-native';

   const MyTouchableComponent = () => {
     const handlePress = () => {
       // Your touchable element press logic here
     };

     return (
       <TouchableOpacity onPress={handlePress}>
         <Text>Touchable Element</Text>
       </TouchableOpacity>
     );
   };
   ```

These are some of the basic components youll commonly use in React Native with Expo CLI. However, there are many more components and APIs available, depending on your application's requirements. As you progress, you can explore navigation, state management, and third-party libraries to enhance your React Native development skills further. Additionally, the official documentation for React Native and Expo provides detailed information and examples for each component and API, which can be a valuable resource as you continue your learning journey.
