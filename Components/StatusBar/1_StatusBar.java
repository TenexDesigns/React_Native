  const [route, setRoute] = useState('home');

  const renderStatusBar = () => {
    switch (route) {
      case 'home':
        return <StatusBar backgroundColor="red" barStyle="light-content" />;
      case 'about':
        return <StatusBar backgroundColor="blue" barStyle="dark-content" />;
      default:
        return <StatusBar />;
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {renderStatusBar()}
      <Text>This is my app!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
