To use global styles in React Native, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new file called `globalStyles.js` in the root directory of your React Native project.
2. In the `globalStyles.js` file, export a JavaScript object that contains your global styles.
3. In your React Native code, import the `globalStyles.js` file and use the global styles in your components.

Here is an example of a global styles file:

```javascript
export default {
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: '#333',
  },
  button: {
    backgroundColor: '#000',
    padding: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
};
```

Here is an example of how to use global styles in a React Native component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';
import globalStyles from './globalStyles';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={globalStyles.container}>
      <Text style={globalStyles.text}>This is some text with global styles.</Text>
      <Button style={globalStyles.button}>Click Me</Button>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This code will render a `View` component with a `Text` component and a `Button` component. The `Text` component will have the global styles `fontSize` and `color` applied to it. The `Button` component will have the global style `backgroundColor` applied to it.

You can use global styles for any style that you want to apply to multiple components in your React Native app. For example, you could use global styles for the following:

* Font sizes and colors
* Background colors and borders
* Margins and padding
* Flexbox properties
* Shadow styles

Using global styles can help to reduce the amount of code that you need to write and make it easier to maintain your React Native app.

Here are some additional tips for using global styles in React Native:

* Use descriptive names for your global styles. This will make it easier to find and use them in your components.
* Avoid using global styles for styles that are specific to individual components. This will make your code more reusable and easier to maintain.
* If you need to override a global style in a component, you can do so by passing the style to the component as a prop.

I hope this helps!
