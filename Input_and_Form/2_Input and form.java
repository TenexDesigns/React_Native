**Which input and form components should you use?**

The best input and form components for you to use will depend on your specific needs. If you are looking for basic, easy-to-use components, then the built-in React Native components are a good option. If you need more features or customization, then you may want to consider using a third-party library.

Here are some general guidelines for choosing input and form components:

* If you are building a simple form, then the built-in React Native components are a good option.
* If you need more features or customization, then you may want to consider using a third-party library.
* If you are building a cross-platform app, then you may want to consider using a third-party library that provides cross-platform components.
* If you are building a Material Design app, then you may want to consider using a third-party library that provides Material Design components.

I hope this helps!
