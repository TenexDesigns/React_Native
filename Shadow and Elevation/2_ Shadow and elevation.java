Shadow and elevation in React Native are two different ways to create the illusion of depth for elements on the screen.

**Shadow**

Shadows are created using the `shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, and `shadowRadius` props. The `shadowColor` prop specifies the color of the shadow, the `shadowOffset` prop specifies the offset of the shadow from the element, the `shadowOpacity` prop specifies the opacity of the shadow, and the `shadowRadius` prop specifies the blur radius of the shadow.

The following code sample shows how to use the `shadow` props to create a shadow for a button:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native';

const MyButton = () => {
  return (
    <Button
      title="My Button"
      style={{
        shadowColor: 'black',
        shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
        shadowOpacity: 0.5,
        shadowRadius: 10,
      }}
    />
  );
};

export default MyButton;
```

This code will render a button with a black shadow that is offset by 0 pixels horizontally and 2 pixels vertically. The shadow will have an opacity of 0.5 and a blur radius of 10 pixels.

**Elevation**

Elevation is a property that is specific to React Native for Android. It is used to create the illusion of depth for elements on the screen by raising them above other elements.

The following code sample shows how to use the `elevation` prop to create an elevation for a button:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native';

const MyButton = () => {
  return (
    <Button
      title="My Button"
      style={{
        elevation: 10,
      }}
    />
  );
};

export default MyButton;
```

This code will render a button that is raised 10 pixels above other elements on the screen.

**Do they work on both Android and iOS?**

Shadow and elevation do not work exactly the same way on Android and iOS. Shadows are supported on both platforms, but elevation is only supported on Android.

On iOS, shadows are rendered using the Core Graphics framework. On Android, shadows are rendered using the View system. This difference in rendering can lead to subtle differences in the appearance of shadows on the two platforms.

For example, shadows on iOS are typically rendered with a softer edge than shadows on Android. Additionally, shadows on iOS can be cast on other elements on the screen, while shadows on Android cannot.

**Libraries that enable use of shadows on both iOS and Android**

There are a number of libraries that can be used to enable the use of shadows on both iOS and Android. One popular library is `react-native-shadow`.

`react-native-shadow` is a library that provides a shadow component that can be used to create shadows on both iOS and Android. The `react-native-shadow` component is based on the iOS Core Graphics framework, so it produces shadows that are consistent with the native look and feel of iOS.

To use `react-native-shadow`, you simply need to install the package from npm and add the `Shadow` component to your code. The following code sample shows how to use `react-native-shadow` to create a shadow for a button:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Shadow, Button } from 'react-native-shadow';

const MyButton = () => {
  return (
    <Shadow>
      <Button title="My Button" />
    </Shadow>
  );
};

export default MyButton;
```

This code will render a button with a shadow that is consistent with the native look and feel of iOS.

**Conclusion**

Shadow and elevation are two different ways to create the illusion of depth for elements on the screen in React Native. Shadows are supported on both iOS and Android, but elevation is only supported on Android.

There are a number of libraries that can be used to enable the use of shadows on both iOS and Android. One popular library is `react-native-shadow`.
