In React Native, shadows and elevation are used to create depth and visual cues in the UI. However, the properties used to create these effects differ between iOS and Android platforms.

On iOS, you can use the following properties to create a shadow:

- `shadowColor`: Sets the color of the shadow.
- `shadowOffset`: Sets the position of the shadow relative to the box.
- `shadowOpacity`: Sets the transparency of the shadow.
- `shadowRadius`: Sets the blur radius of the shadow.

Here's an example on how to create a shadow on an iOS device:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const ShadowBox = () => (
  <View style={styles.box} />
);

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: 60,
    height: 60,
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.8,
    shadowRadius: 3,
    backgroundColor: '#00FF00',
  },
});

export default ShadowBox;
```
In this example, a green box with a shadow is created. The shadow is black (`#000`), slightly offset downwards, quite opaque (`0.8`), and slightly blurred (`3`) [Source 0](https://www.waldo.com/blog/react-native-shadow).

However, Android does not support these properties. Instead, it uses the `elevation` property, which is a combination of `shadowOffset`, `shadowRadius`, and `shadowOpacity`. The `shadowColor` property can be used to change the color of the shadow, but it only works on Android API 28 and above [Source 5](https://reactnative.dev/docs/shadow-props), [Source 17](https://www.kindacode.com/article/react-native-how-to-add-shadow-effects-on-android/).

Here's an example on how to create elevation on an Android device:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const ElevationBox = () => (
  <View style={styles.box} />
);

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: 60,
    height: 60,
    elevation: 8,
    backgroundColor: '#00FF00',
  },
});

export default ElevationBox;
```
In this example, a green box with an elevation of `8` is created, which will appear as a shadow on Android devices [Source 0](https://www.waldo.com/blog/react-native-shadow).

To create consistent shadows across both iOS and Android, you can use third-party libraries such as `react-native-drop-shadow` [Source 4](https://blog.logrocket.com/applying-box-shadows-in-react-native/) or `react-native-shadow-view` [Source 22](https://github.com/ConduitMobileRND/react-native-simple-shadow-view).

Here's an example using `react-native-drop-shadow`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import DropShadow from 'react-native-drop-shadow';

const ShadowBox = () => (
  <DropShadow
    style={{
      shadowColor: '#000',
      shadowOffset: { width: 10, height: 10 },
      shadowOpacity: 0.3,
      shadowRadius: 2,
    }}
  >
    <View style={{ width: 60, height: 60, backgroundColor: '#00FF00' }} />
  </DropShadow>
);

export default ShadowBox;
```
In this example, `react-native-drop-shadow` is used to create a green box with a shadow that is consistent across both iOS and Android platforms.
