In React Native, the box model is a way to describe how layout works. The box model consists of four parts: content, padding, border, and margin. The content is the area where your text or images appear, the padding is the space between the content and the border, the border is what surrounds the padding and content, and the margin is the space between the borders of adjacent elements [Source 5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model).

React Native uses a "border-box" model, which means that the width and height properties include the content, padding and border, but not the margin [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42406752/how-does-the-react-native-box-model-work). This is different from the standard CSS box model, where the width and height only includes the content.

Let's consider a simple Box component created using React Native:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const Box = () => (
  <View style={styles.box} />
);

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: 60,
    height: 60,
    margin: 10,
    padding: 10,
    borderWidth: 2,
    borderColor: '#000000',
    backgroundColor: '#00FF00',
  },
});

export default Box;
```

In this example, the box has a width and height of 60 pixels, a margin of 10 pixels, a padding of 10 pixels, and a border width of 2 pixels. The total width and height of the box would be 60 pixels (width/height) + 20 pixels (padding) + 4 pixels (border), which equals 84 pixels [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42406752/how-does-the-react-native-box-model-work).

React Native also provides a `flexbox` model to help with layout. The `flexbox` model is great for defining how components distribute space along a single column or row. It can be used to resize and position multiple child elements within a parent container [Source 1](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).

In the following example, we create a parent container with three child boxes. The `flex` property is used to specify how much of the available space in the container should be taken up by each box:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const FlexBoxes = () => (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <View style={[styles.box, { flex: 1 }]} />
    <View style={[styles.box, { flex: 2 }]} />
    <View style={[styles.box, { flex: 3 }]} />
  </View>
);

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
  },
  box: {
    borderWidth: 2,
    borderColor: '#000000',
  },
});

export default FlexBoxes;
```

In this example, the `flex` values of 1, 2, and 3 mean that the first box will take up 1/6 of the total space, the second box will take up 2/6 (or 1/3), and the third box will take up 3/6 (or 1/2) [Source 1](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).

In conclusion, the box model and the `flexbox` model in React Native are powerful tools for controlling layout and positioning in your apps.
