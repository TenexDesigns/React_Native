**SectionList** is a React Native component that allows you to render sectioned lists. It is a convenience wrapper around `VirtualizedList`, and thus inherits its props (as well as those of `ScrollView`) that aren't explicitly listed here, along with the following caveats:

* Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.
* This is a PureComponent which means that it will not re-render if props remain shallow-equal. Make sure that everything your renderItem function depends on is passed as a prop (e.g. extraData) that is not === after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on changes. This includes the data prop and parent component state.
* In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application, and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.
* By default, the list looks for a key prop on each item and uses that for the React key. Alternatively, you can provide a custom keyExtractor prop.

**Props**

The following are some of the most common props for `SectionList`:

* `renderItem`: A function that will be called to render each item in the list.
* `sections`: An array of objects that represent the sections in the list. Each object in the array should have a `data` prop, which is an array of objects that represent the items in the section.
* `keyExtractor`: A function that will be called to extract a unique key for each item in the list.
* `renderSectionHeader`: A function that will be called to render the header for each section.
* `renderSectionFooter`: A function that will be called to render the footer for each section.
* `ItemSeparatorComponent`: A component that will be rendered between each item in the list.
* `SectionSeparatorComponent`: A component that will be rendered between each section in the list.

**Methods**

The following are some of the most common methods for `SectionList`:

* `scrollToLocation()`: Scrolls to the item at the specified sectionIndex and itemIndex (within the section) positioned in the viewable area such that viewPosition 0 places it at the top (and may be covered by a sticky header), 1 at the bottom, and 0.5 centered in the middle.

**Example**

The following code sample shows how to use `SectionList` to render a simple sectioned list:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { SectionList } from 'react-native';

const data = [
  {
    title: 'Section 1',
    data: [
      { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Section 2',
    data: [
      { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' },
      { id: 4, name: 'Item 4' },
    ],
  },
];

const renderItem = ({ item }) => (
  <Text key={item.id}>{item.name}</Text>
);

const renderSectionHeader = ({ section }) => (
  <Text key={section.title}>{section.title}</Text>
);

const MyComponent = () => (
  <SectionList
    sections={data}
    renderItem={renderItem}
    renderSectionHeader={renderSectionHeader}
  />
);

export default MyComponent;
```

This code will render a list with two sections, each with two items. The header for each section will display the section title.

**How to use `SectionList`**

To use `SectionList`, you need to pass two required props: `sections` and `renderItem`. The `sections` prop is an array of objects that represent the sections in the list. The `renderItem` prop is a function that will be called to render each item in the list.

You can also pass optional props to `SectionList` to customize its appearance and behavior. For example, you can pass a `renderSectionHeader` prop to render the header for each section, or you can pass a `renderSectionFooter` prop to render the footer for each section.

**Why use `SectionList`?**

`SectionList` is a good choice for rendering sectioned lists because it is optimized for performance
