In React Native, there isn't a direct concept of "relative" and "absolute" layouts like you might find in some other UI frameworks. React Native primarily uses Flexbox for layout, which provides a flexible and responsive way to design user interfaces.

However, you can achieve layouts that behave in ways similar to "relative" and "absolute" layouts by using a combination of Flexbox, positioning, and styling. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Relative Layout**:

   A relative layout is typically used to arrange components relative to each other or to their parent container. In React Native, you can achieve this using Flexbox, which is the primary layout system. You can use properties like `flex`, `alignItems`, and `justifyContent` to control the positioning of elements relative to their parent and each other.

   ```jsx
   <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row' }}>
     <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'red' }} />
     <View style={{ flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
     <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'green' }} />
   </View>
   ```

   In this example, the child views are arranged relative to each other using flex ratios.

2. **Absolute Layout**:

   An absolute layout is used to position elements at specific coordinates on the screen, typically using `(x, y)` coordinates. In React Native, you can achieve this by using the `position: 'absolute'` style property along with `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` properties to specify the exact position.

   ```jsx
   <View style={{ position: 'absolute', left: 20, top: 20 }}>
     <Text>Absolute Positioning</Text>
   </View>
   ```

   This will position the `<Text>` component 20 points from the left and 20 points from the top of its parent or container.

Remember that using absolute positioning should be done sparingly, as it can lead to layout issues, especially on different screen sizes and orientations. It's often better to use Flexbox for most of your layout needs.

To summarize, React Native primarily uses Flexbox for layouts, which provides a flexible and responsive way to design interfaces. While you can achieve relative and absolute positioning through styling, it's recommended to follow Flexbox principles for most layout tasks to ensure a responsive and consistent UI across devices.
