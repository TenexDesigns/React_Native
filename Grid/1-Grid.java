Yes, there are a few ways to display items in a grid in React Native. One way is to use the Flexbox layout system. Flexbox is a powerful layout system that can be used to create a variety of layouts, including grids.

To create a grid using Flexbox, you can use the flexDirection and flexWrap properties. The flexDirection property determines the direction in which the items in the grid will be laid out. For example, to create a grid with rows, you would set the flexDirection property to row.

The flexWrap property determines whether the items in the grid will wrap to a new line if there is not enough space on the current line. For example, to create a grid where the items will wrap to a new line when there is not enough space on the current line, you would set the flexWrap property to wrap.

Here is an example of how to create a grid using Flexbox:

JavaScript
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
      <View style={{ width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'red' }} />
      <View style={{ width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'green' }} />
      <View style={{ width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;

This code will create a grid with three items. The items will be laid out in a row and will wrap to a new line when there is not enough space on the current line.
