SafeAreaView is a component in React Native that helps ensure that your content remains visible within the safe area of the device's screen. It automatically adjusts the positioning of your content to avoid overlapping with system UI elements like the status bar, notches, or navigation bars.

By default, SafeAreaView is only available on iOS, but you can apply a similar concept to Android using a combination of StatusBar and flexbox.

Here's an example of how you can apply SafeAreaView in React Native for both iOS and Android:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, SafeAreaView, StyleSheet, Platform, StatusBar } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        {/* Your content goes here */}
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    paddingTop: Platform.OS === 'android' ? StatusBar.currentHeight : 0,
  },
  content: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#FDF853',
  },
});

export default App;
```

In the above example, we use the `SafeAreaView` component as a wrapper around the main content of the app. The `container` style has a `flex: 1` property, which makes it take up the entire screen. 

To handle the safe area on Android, we use the `StatusBar.currentHeight` property to determine the height of the status bar and add top padding to the container accordingly. This ensures that the content is not covered by the status bar on Android devices.

By using this approach, your content will be properly positioned within the safe area on both iOS and Android devices, providing a consistent user experience.
